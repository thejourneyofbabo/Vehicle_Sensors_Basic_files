%  Description: An exercise code to practice search and registration following four instruction
%  Instruction: 1. Load the teapot point cloud which used in the practice.
%               2. Make two point cloud dividing it into upper and lower point clouds through search algorithm (findPointsInROI).
%               3. Transform one of them (upper one).
%               4. And register them using NDT registration algorithm.
